# Introduction

Hi, I'm Garry. I'm a Computer Science undergraduate based in the United Kingdom. I love technology, programming, photography, repairing electronics, music, and travel.

This website started as a bit of a flex to my friends back in secondary school. Over time, it’s evolved into my personal blog, electronic resume, and a showcase for my photography and projects (as well as just a bit of fun).

# What You'll Find

## Blog

I don’t post often, I prefer to keep to myself, and I’m careful about what I put online. Mostly, though, I either lack the time or get too carried away with my projects to document them in a way that feels worth sharing.

I’m also (to my own detriment) a perfectionist when it comes to public-facing things. For example, I’ve rebuilt this site countless times in pursuit of the “perfect” design. Of course, it’s never quite perfect in my eyes, so eventually I start fresh again, hence the many, many revisions of my personal website.

## Resume

I was never especially academic. While I didn’t struggle much in school, I wasn’t deeply interested in the content, and instead preferred to teach myself technologies and topics that actually excited me.

At the moment, I don’t have the extensive work history I’d like, but I’m working on that. I’m always looking for opportunities to grow and develop my skills.

## Landing Page

This site also doubles as my landing page. It ties together my email domain and serves as a central hub for everything relevant about me, something I can share with people as a quick overview of my experience and passions.

I always aim to make a strong first impression.

## Projects

I’m currently working on getting my gallery back online and starting my own web radio station. Soon, I hope to have an extensive projects page showcasing all the interesting things I’ve been building.

# Brief History

As I mentioned earlier, this site started as a side project in secondary school. I registered the domain in 2022, mostly so I could have personalised email addresses for different services and contacts. Since then, it’s gone through many revisions, redesigns, and technologies (from WordPress to static pages).

It has grown from a simple landing page into a personal blog and portfolio.

Why “garrynet 2.0”? Well, I felt like I’d gotten too comfortable with how it was maintained before. It became boring and outdated. I decided to try something new, lightening the load on my servers, improving the user experience, and giving myself an opportunity to learn new hosting approaches.

Looking ahead, I want this site to become a fully fleshed-out portfolio of my proudest work, something I can truly take pride in and unashamedly call my own little corner of the internet.

Thanks for reading.

-Garry
