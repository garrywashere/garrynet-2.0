# Hello, World!

It's finally done, finally ready. This project has been baking for months. I’d been putting off reprovisioning my server for so long, leaving my old blog unmaintained because the setup was just too bulky and unoptimised. Well, now it’s perfect: reliable, blazing-fast, just perfect.

The gallery is up again, which is insane considering how long it’s been since it was last online. But after all this time, I’ve learned new techniques and technologies. Everything is accounted for, and it’s just splendid.

I’d love to ramble on about how happy and giddy I am to see everything working again, I truly am, but it’s long past time for me to sleep. I’ve been at this all night, taking advantage of the sudden rush of motivation before it fades.

Either way, I’ll be able to better share my enthusiasm tomorrow, when I don’t feel like I’m rotting at my desk.

Thank you.

And in case I don’t see you: good afternoon, good evening, and good night.

—Garry
