## Quick Update: Economy Isn’t Looking Too Hot

So, I'm almost a month into my second year. Don't get me wrong, it's great fun and all but the fucking price rises (everywhere) do not help.

Not only have the following skyrocketed since my last academic year:

- Car Insurance
- Diesel Prices
- Food & Drink Costs
- Rent
- Subscription Service Prices
- Tuition Fees

But things such as food and drink have significantly reduced in both quality and quantity. It's ridiculous, here's a quick anecdote:

> My friends recently drove down to visit me, we went to Sainsbury's to grab some snacks for the road. All the things we usually get, the packaging is the exact same and indicates no change to the product. However, there's noticeably less product contained within. And alongside that – the price was up 20-30% to what we remember.

It's downright diabolical, trying to survive as a student in big 2025. It's bad enough you get shafted with coursework and examinations (even better for me because the majority of my modules are in the Autumn term, meaning I have to cram two thirds of my year into the first three months), but you also have to constantly worry about money.

## Another Obvious One: Government Bad

I understand there's a financial crisis; and I despise politics. But this government is truly appalling, never have I personally borne witness to so many lies, such display of unprofessionalism and treason towards a government's own people.

Recently, we had an incident here in Colchester, I had to go to the Police station with a colleague to report an egregious criminal fraud organisation that said colleague became a victim of, we were happy to hand over a barrage of evidence and file a report (mind you there were like 20 people whose full names and phone numbers we had, that were defrauding tens of thousands of pounds), yet we were turned away.

It seems Essex Police is far too busy investigating, arresting and jailing people committing the victimless crimes of expressing their opinions online. Mind you, some of the things these people say can be vile and I personally don't agree with, but it's a fucking opinion.

At the time of writing, the UK's own Human Rights Act 1998 (Article 10) states that to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without government interference is a human right<sup>[1]</sup>.

Which is ironic when you consider the fact our Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, used to be a human rights lawyer<sup>[2]</sup> – yet under him you see countless reports of Police resources being diverted to arresting innocent civilians expressing unfavourable opinions on social media.

I'll leave you with this clip:

### Transcript

**Kisin**: In Russia last year, _400_ people were arrested for things they said on social media. How many people do you think were arrested in Britain for things they said on social media last year?

**Anderson**: Go on.

**Kisin**: Take a guess.

**Anderson**: I have no idea.

**Kisin**: _3,300_

**Anderson**: Really? Arrested for what they'd said on social media? What sort of things get you arrested?

Make of that what you will.

## Last Note

Ever since coming back I've been pulling my hair out, trying to stay on top of things and maintaining a clear mind is difficult when the world around you is falling apart. It feels as though every week there's some kind of horrific [political violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Charlie_Kirk) that results in bloodshed, a new [terror attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_synagogue_attack), an _alleged_ [cover-up scandal](https://www.gbnews.com/politics/grooming-gangs-london-sadiq-khan-london) that shows the people running our country are scum of the earth, or so-called [“peaceful” protests](https://www.thejc.com/news/uk/defend-our-juries-palestine-action-refuse-police-delay-ep9pkygl) that disregard public appeals for restraint, go ahead in the wake of national tragedies, and feature [disturbing displays of antisemitic rhetoric on the streets](https://antisemitism.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/6648-Anitsemitism-Trust-Chants-Report-v4.pdf).

I just want to survive.
