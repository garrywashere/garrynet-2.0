## Introduction

Since learning to comprehend, speak, read, and write English, I’ve always been fascinated with writing. As a kid, I used to write short stories. Much like my love for photography, writing allows me to capture experiences—the things I see, hear, taste, smell, or feel—and preserve them in a form that can be revisited later.

That’s the beauty of writing. Just like a camera’s resolution and framing shape a photo, a writer’s ability to capture detail and perspective shapes the reading experience.

## Chapter 1: The Blog

I’m still figuring out how I want to structure my blog, but it’s getting clearer. I plan to separate it into three categories, organised with tags:

-   **#blog** — My personal posts: daily thoughts, reflections, and interests. A way to pause at the end of the day, recall events, and jot down ideas.
-   **#guide** — Tutorials and how-tos on things like server setups, virtual environments, or troubleshooting. A place to share knowledge and centralise resources.
-   **#deepdive** — The main focus: long-form articles where I research and analyse topics in detail, with references and structured explanations.

## Chapter 2: Understanding Structure

One of my biggest challenges—whether in writing or other work—is structure. I like consistent workflows. When setting up servers, for example, I keep documents detailing how configurations should be laid out. Structure matters to me.

The downside is that I sometimes waste time obsessing over rules and consistency instead of making progress.

Still, I believe structure is valuable. It makes work more digestible, recognisable, and almost signature-like. Over time, these habits give my work its own identity.

## Chapter 3: Creating a Structure for Articles

This brings me to my current struggle: not having a reliable framework for writing articles. I love researching, learning, and explaining things. When speaking with a friend, it’s natural to explain a topic in a way that flows and makes sense.

But writing requires more: clarity, readability, and rhythm. A good article guides the reader’s eye, balances structure with content, and creates flow.

So, I need a structure or workflow I can stick to—a framework that lets me turn scattered notes into something coherent.

## Chapter 4: My Writing Process (For Now)

Right now, my process is pretty raw: I take my internal monologue and dump it onto the page. That’s fine for blog posts like this one, but not ideal for structured articles.

To refine drafts, I rely on iterations. Tools like AI help me spot repetition, cut unnecessary tangents, and polish flow. It’s like having a personal assistant for editing.

Once I’m happy, I do a final proofread and hit publish. Simple—but imperfect.

## Chapter 5: What’s Next?

I probably won’t discover my “perfect” writing style immediately. Like most things, it will take time and practice.

Here’s what I know I enjoy:

-   Research
-   Explaining
-   Referencing

And here’s what I believe an article should do:

-   Inform
-   Entertain
-   Provoke thought
-   Condense knowledge into something digestible

I understand the basics: an introduction, a middle, and a conclusion. But the “meat” of an article—the core structure—is where I stumble.

For example, I want to write about the current state of generative AI music. Big AI companies are being sued by indie artists and record labels over training practices. I’ve gathered plenty of information, including court documents, but I’m still figuring out how best to organise it.

---

## Conclusion

So, I’ll keep practicing. Writing blog posts like this might feel like rambling, but I see it as training.

Ultimately, my bigger goal is to write a PhD thesis in Computer Science. That will require strong skills in researching, organising, and presenting ideas. This blog is where I build those muscles.

As always, thanks for reading. Hopefully, by the time you’re seeing this, I’ve managed to polish it into something worth sharing.
